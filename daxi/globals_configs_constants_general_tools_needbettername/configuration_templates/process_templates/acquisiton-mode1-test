Description: "this is a test configuration for the development of mode1 acquisiton pipeline, which is done while desgning the
architecture of the DaXi controller codes. This should follow the format recognizable by the parser."

These configurations should be pared with the device_configs_core, as well as the alignment and calibration records.
it should contain information enough for the client to know which focused process facilitator to use
it should contain all the specific acquisition parameter that is suggeste and chose from the SystemFcltr.
it should also contain the specific information for the command to handle all the receiveres. but this is specific for
some titles for the process.
