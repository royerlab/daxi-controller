"""
this demo should recieve a process configuration file (from the yaml file),
generate the configurations for all cycles ()
map it into single_cycle configs dict

then the devices facilitator is going to have a method called 'map single cylce'
or something that can be called by a focused group orcess faiclitator, and it will
map the configurations to the single clc configurations attributes ready to execute

after this, should go ahead and implement the focused process fcltr to do that for mode 1.

also need a data-refresh type of method in the device facilitator
