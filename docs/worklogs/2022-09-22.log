get a parser
worked on nidaq module.

how to find out the counter channel names?

2022-09-26


finish up everything about metronome
module
test
demo

Features:
task bundle, AO task bundle, and implement a demo to generate sine wave.

DO task bundle


how to deal with forgetting about the details in the design of features, etc.
write notes.

write the configuration book.

11:33 am:
1. warm up and pick up what was left over from yesterday
develop the aotaskbundle and aosubtask module

norming the process.


work on the following aspects each time when you start to work on a new feature:
1. module code it self, refactor when necessary, take notes of the thoughts.
2. update the parser, and the paser test. # derive demo from the tests.
2. write the test codes
3. write the demo cdes
4. write the read me to note down the throught process
5. write in the log to note down the big picture thought processes.

4:32 - pm updated the parser and it's tests. prepared 3 testing terminals for tests.
may need to put in more configurations into the oscilloscope configurations in the configs txt file.
decided to keep all configurations in a single file.

4:03 pm:
[] continue with aotaskbundle and subtask,
[] refactor the data generator function into the daxi package. where to find? devices
[] finish ao task bundle, and ao subtask module. demo with 3 oscilloscopes all attached to the ao bundle.

4: work on data generator funciton for sinusoidal function first, and configure it for oscilloscope1 config.
generator function should be wired by the facilitator.

think about how to define the subtasks-- perhaps define it directly into

scanning galvo


there are devices


there are devices configurations.

how to make it compatible....
