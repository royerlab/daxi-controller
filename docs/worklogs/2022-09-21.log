1. figure out pip packaging workflow and configure daxi-protocol package under development mode
    10:36 am  - started.
    10:44 am - distracted by slack msgs, resume the work. - now check the toml files in other royer lab repos.
    10:53 am - further distracted by emails and slack msgs.. mute all notifications now.
    now - refactoring the folders
    organize the toml file
    veresion files
    install a directory in editable mode:
        command: pip install -e path-to-directory
            - overwrite the directory in site-packages with a symbolic link to the locations repository,
              meaning any changes to code in there will automatically be reflected - just reload the
              page (so long as you're using the development server).
        need:
            setup.py
    11:19 am - read this:
        https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/
        follow this instructions:
        https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#requirements-for-packaging-and-distributing
        11:49 -  finished configuring setup.py
        11:54 - figuringout MANIFIST.ini, how to generate it
        12:00 - seems finished with the editable mode isntallation.

    12:01 - miniplanning
       - redefine workflow - 12:04 to
       12:06 - now try to find useful patterns of the workflow on github
       - update workflow prompt messages.
       - try to write tests for the daxi package for datatypes. start from configuration classes.
        2:10 continue.

        7:29 - ahh!
        finished configuring the editable installation of daxi package.
        finished initial trial of implementing the laser base module and the associated test cases.

    7:30 pm
        now implement the structure.
        implement ao tools.
        impelemnt up to the point make WKB structure in the code structure, and mark asn todo.
        now implement our laser.

        think about WBS structure
        Today - enable the previosu demos in the new daxi package folder.

            define configuraiton files


    later in the day
    look into pytest fixtures, and the temporary path for tests.
    10:47.. trouble shoot the installatin and paths issues in pycharm and the terminals
    thought about the daq controlled devices structure.

WBS laser module:
    need some interactive diagnostic tools that are connected to the DAQ cards.
    have a collection of diagnostic tools that are totally independent from each other.
